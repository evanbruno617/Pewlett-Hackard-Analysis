* By analyzing how many people are retiring based on their title it seems that Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are taking the largest hit with most of our employees retiring from these titles. We will need to focus more on filling these roles. Following this roles we then need to focus on are Engineers followed by Staff and Technique Leader. 
* The part of our workforce this isn't hit as hard is our Managers and Assistant Engineers so we do not need to focus as much on filling these roles.

* From the employees eligible for mentorship program we have a majority of them in Senior Engineer, Staff, Engineer, and Senior Staff. This is preferrable because these positions are the ones we need to hire new employees the most. 
* By comparing the amount of employees retiring to the amount of employees eligible for mentorship there is a huge disproportionate ratio in Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.

The amount of roles we need to fill are our Engineers with over 35,000 employees retiring and our Staff with over 30,000 retiring. A total of 72,458 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" makes it's impact.

There are not enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mento rthe next generation of employees as they are far fewer than the amount that are retiring. In these positions we will have to conduct group mentorships in order to hire as many employees as possible before our's retires.
