* By analyzing how many people are retiring based on their title it seems that Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are taking the largest hit with most of our employees retiring from these titles. We will need to focus more on filling these roles. Following this roles we then need to focus on are Engineers followed by Staff and Technique Leader. 
* The part of our workforce this isn't hit as hard is our Managers and Assistant Engineers so we do not need to focus as much on filling these roles.
